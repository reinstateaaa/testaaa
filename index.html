This institution hypocritically encourages a renaissance scholar mentality while limiting low-income students\' ability to pursue those very achievements. Students in the class of 2026 and 2027\’s enrollment decisions factored in these opportunities, and for some were the deciding factor to commit to USC. Maliciously luring these non-affluent students to enroll under this guise for unnecessary, exorbitant profit is immoral, elitist, and goes against the very mission statement you are supposed to uphold: “Our mission provides direction for every member of the USC community as we shape a bold future focused on academic excellence, research, caring for our patients, and exploration of artistic and athletic excellence.” While the response from the Office of Academic Programs provides direction for every member of the USC community to talk with their academic advisors to “discuss potential changes to their course plan.” This response is a spit in the face to anyone who made the mistake of expecting USC\’s values to be anything more than just a facade. Is it not enough that you increase our tuition every year? The nationwide inflation rate of 3% doesn’t excuse raising tuition by almost twice that rate. Is it not enough that you instate unnecessary hurdles for transfering in credit? By preventing AP test scores from counting towards WRIT requirements, as well as denying high school dual enrollment credits to be transferred creates artificial hurdles to prolong students\' stay at USC. You are the very reason why our college rank continues to decrease. Not just making these programs unaffordable for future students, but removing scholarship opportunities from current scholars only serves to line your pockets at the expense of USC\’s reputation and more importantly our academic careers. We the student body demand change from Andrew McConnel Stott’s current elitist policy decisions and Erik Brink’s negligence to the risks associated. If funds are needed that desperately, which we know isn’t the case from the public history of USC’s financial reports, decrease the president\'s 4 million dollar salary. Cut down the head football coach\’s 10 million dollar salary. Tap into the over 11 billion dollars of your growing net assets. End this legacy of prioritizing corporate greed over student\'s academic success and holistic wellbeing.\n\n\tThis recent decision on top of consistent price hikes and needless unacademic hurdles not seen in other institutions not only contradicts USC\’s foundational principles, but will force current and prospective students to turn to other universities. UCLA for example, has a flat rate tuition which covers unlimited units to be taken within 4 years. To deter this, we only request that you reinstate the Academic Achievement Award as soon as possible. Let this only be remembered as a momentary lapse in judgment, not of two wealthy, white, men sodden with privilege capitalizing off a less fortunate student population. We desperately need this opportunity that was promised to us. Our education and enrollment status are in your hands.\n\nSincerely,\nAn affected student';

        <h2 class="yellow-text">Why We Are Angry:</h2>
        <p>The Academic Achievement Award (AAA) first began in 2010 as a means to “make it easier for students with excellent academic records to graduate with multiple programs of study and still graduate in four years…without an extra cost” (Gene Bickers, former vice provost for undergraduate education). For more than a decade, AAA has granted high-performing students the ability to pursue all aspirations no matter their financial limitations, confirming and fortifying USC’s principle of an unlimited, interdisciplinary education. That is, until now. On March 8, the Office of Academic Programs suddenly removed the award, forcing students to pay $2,137 per added unit. Students who expected to take part in the program are now left reeling and grappling for solutions. By removing AAA, USC is disenfranchising its most ambitious and deserving students. It is taking advantage of low-income students by restricting their education for unnecessary, exorbitant profit, pulling the rug from under those who expected AAA to be available to them when committing to USC. Join us now in reversing the removal of AAA by signing our petition and contacting those in charge.</p>
